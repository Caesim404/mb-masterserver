Allows selecting what masterserver Mount&Blade client should use.
Also allows some manipulation of keys the client sends.

Should work on both windows and linux (maybe mac).
Needs python 2 or 3.

Notes:
    The keys the client sends are located:
        in windows:
            in registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MountAndBladeWarbandKeys
        in unix:
            each in a file in ~/.mbwarband/
    
    masterserver.ini contains the same options that you can type in masterserver.py.
    
    Make sure you change "path" value to the path to your game exe in masterserver.ini.
    
    Don't forget to patch your game exe before running it (type "patch").
    
    To apply all options in a section of masterserver.ini type "use sectionNameHere".
    
    Linux only:
        Make sure you edit the "user" value to your username in masterserver.ini

    For list of commands and options run masterserver.py and type "help". Some things are unlisted, so see source code.
